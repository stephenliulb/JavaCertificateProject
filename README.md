# JavaCertificateProject
This project  was from my Sun certificated Java Developer. 
It only use Java libraries (required for the certificate exam), not importing any third party libraries.
The purpose is to present examples related to Java knowledge and skills.

A mini database server was designed and implemented to persist data atomically under multi-thread context;  also a back-end server was created using underlying sockets to handle the incoming requests and send back the responses.
